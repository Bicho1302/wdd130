            <h2>The Art of Sublimation</h2>
            <p>Sublimation is a great process that allows for vibrant, full color, all-over prints that are exceptionally durable. 
                Naturally the magic of the process lies in the printing technology. With designs infused directly onto the fabric, 
                they become a part of the fabric itself. All of the design elements including the team logo, colors, and numbers 
                become a part of the fabric in sublimation as opposed to other processes like embroidery, where they're “sewn” 
                onto the surface. So, there's no scope for the colors or logos to peel off or fade in sublimated jerseys!
                Besides the high temperature and pressures used in sublimation convert the prints into gas, which bonds firmly 
                with the molecules of the fabric, fully integrating with them. Totally inseparable!

          <h2>ADVANTAGES OF SUBLIMATION</h2> 
           <p> 1.-Vibrant colors, making it perfect for photographic images. </p>
           <p>2.-Ability to create complex all-over sublimation designs or prints on the front and back of your uniforms.</p>
           <p>3.-You can't feel the print at all, giving the fabric a soft feel.</p>
           <p> 4.-Sublimation print will not crack, peel, or fade.</p>
           <p>5.-Enhance your garment by adding elements such as, rhinestones, hot fix glitter or foil with heat transfer.</p>
           <p>6.-Sublimation printing never goes out of style. Because sublimated jerseys and uniforms are custom made, 
            there is no need to worry about a uniform being discontinued next season. It is also easy to reorder one from
             us in the future as we keep your design on file.
