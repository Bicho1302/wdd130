        The people on this website will be able to find out and learn about the different types of 
        things that you can do with sublimation, they will be able to obtain quick and simple 
        information to make it easier to learn about what you can do with sublimation. Many people ask 
        “What is sublimation printing and why choose to sublimate vs. screen print” or “What is sublimation? 
        Sublimation is the process of transferring dye to a fabric using heat. The images and graphics are 
        printed on special paper placed on the garment and heat is applied, allowing the ink to become part 
        of the fabric. This will leave you with a more breathable, soft-hand feel to the fabric. The best part 
        is that the numbers, letters, and graphics do not peel, wear off, or come out in the wash!

      <h3>The art of Sublimation</h3>
      <p>
        People interested in sublimation will visit this website to learn more about sublimation 
        and the art you can create with this method. Surely different questions 
        will be asked: How does sublimation work? What kind of things can you do with sublimation? 
        We will answer these and more questions to the people who visit our website. Sublimation is a great
         process that allows for vibrant, full color, all-over prints that are exceptionally durable. 
         Naturally the magic of the process lies in the printing technology. With designs infused directly 
         onto the fabric, they become a part of the fabric itself. All of the design elements including the 
         team logo, colors, and numbers become a part of the fabric in sublimation as opposed to other processes 
         like embroidery, where they are “sewn” onto the surface. So, there is no scope for the colors or logos to peel off or fade in sublimated jerseys!
        Besides the high temperature and pressures used in sublimation convert the prints into gas,
         which bonds firmly with the molecules of the fabric, fully integrating with them. Totally inseparable!</p>
        <h3> ADVANTAGES OF SUBLIMATION</h3>

     <p>1.-Vibrant colors, making it perfect for photographic images.</p>

     <p>2.-Ability to create complex all-over sublimation designs or prints on the front and back of your uniforms.</p>

     <p>3.-You can't feel the print at all, giving the fabric a soft feel.</p>

     <p> 4.-Sublimation print will not crack, peel, or fade.</p>

     <p>5.-Enhance your garment by adding elements such as, rhinestones, hot fix glitter or foil with heat transfer.</p>

     <p>6.-Sublimation printing never goes out of style. Because sublimated jerseys and uniforms are custom made, 
     there is no need to worry about a uniform being discontinued next season. It is also easy to reorder one from us 
     in the future as we keep your design on file.</p>

      <h3>Types of Sublimation</h3>
      <p>
        The information that the web page will have will be about, 
       the types of sublimation that exist, how sublimation works,
        all this information will be given so that the audience can be more interested in the topic.</p>
        <h3> Basic sublimation</h3> 
        <p>Is a simple print on multiple different fabrics. It will allow you to have a single graphic/logo on a pair of colored shorts. 
        It will also allow for you to do a multiple color print on our mesh reversibles.</p>
        <h3>Full Sublimation</h3>
        <p>Sublimation printing allows you to gain full control over every inch of your jersey. The design is printed directly onto the 
        fabric before it is sewn together, so designs can span the entire length of the shirt, go across seams, wrap over shoulders, and more.</p>
        <h3> Sublimation</h3>
        <p>Spot sublimation is a process by which a design is applied to a smaller area of a previously sewn white garment. Spot sublimation is 
        often chosen over screen printing because this method can print as many colors as are in your logo (gradients and shading as well) 
        without incurring the additional screen setup fees that would be associated with a multi-colored design.</p>
